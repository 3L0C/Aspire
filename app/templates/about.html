                <h2>Goal-Setting Theory</h2>
                <p>Aspire is built on the principles of Goal-Setting Theory (GST), a psychological theory developed by Edwin Locke and Gary Latham. Their research showed that people who set specific, challenging goals perform better than those with vague or easy goals.</p>

                <p>Key principles of Goal-Setting Theory include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Goals should be clear and specific</li>
                    <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> Goals should be challenging but achievable</li>
                    <li><strong>Commitment:</strong> People must be committed to their goals</li>
                    <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Regular feedback on progress is essential</li>
                    <li><strong>Task Complexity:</strong> Complex goals may need to be broken down</li>
                </ul>
